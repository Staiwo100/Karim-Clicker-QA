# Overview (Scope and Key Findings)

We tested both UI bugs and value errors using inspect element to test higher and lower values for functions such as Nayan to find errors.

Some of our key findings were mainly UI errors and performance issues within the game with the performance issues being more severe and critical rather than the UI errors which were completely visual and didn't hinder the games
performance



# BUG SUMMARY

### 1

 * Fist bump powerup does not disappear after attempting to green the fist bump. This happens whether you fail to green the fist bump or no

### 2

* Power up only works when you press the space bar but not the stop button

### 3

* Game crashes/slows down when too many Nayan's are bought (This depends on device and its power, but tends to happen at around 500 - 1000 Nayan's when bought)

### 4

* UI breaks whenever too many Nayan's are bought (Similar with the bug above)

### 5

* Nayan's cover up coins/second (Visual Error)
